  &nbsp;Salted Caramel Pie</h2>
<p>This supereasy caramel lovers' dream pie is from Simplethings Sandwich &amp; Pie Shop in Los Angeles. The filling is sweetened condensed milk sprinkled lightly with sea salt and baked until thick and gooey, then chilled in a simple graham cracker crust.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>1 1/4 cups graham cracker crumbs (about 5 ounces)</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
      <li>1/4 cup light brown sugar</li>
      <li>Two 14-ounce cans sweetened condensed milk</li>
      <li>Fleur de sel</li>
      <li>2 cups heavy cream&nbsp;</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350°. In a food processor, pulse the graham cracker crumbs with the melted butter and light brown sugar until the crumbs are moistened. Press the crumbs evenly into a 9-inch glass or metal pie plate. Bake for about 10 minutes, just until lightly browned. Let cool. Increase the oven temperature to 425°.</li>
      <li>Scrape the condensed milk into a 9-by-13-inch glass baking dish and sprinkle with a scant 1/2 teaspoon of fleur de sel. Cover the dish with foil and place it in a roasting pan. Add enough hot water to the pan to reach one-third of the way up the side of the baking dish. Bake, lifting the foil to stir 2 or 3 times, until the condensed milk is golden and thickened, about 2 hours; add more water to the roasting pan as necessary. The consistency of the caramel should be like dulce de leche. Don't worry if it is lumpy; it will smooth out as it chills.</li>
      <li>&nbsp;Scrape the caramel filling into the pie crust, smoothing the top. Spray a sheet of plastic wrap with vegetable oil spray and cover the pie. Refrigerate until the filling is chilled and set, at least 4 hours.</li>
      <li>&nbsp;In a bowl, using an electric mixer, beat the cream with the confectioners' sugar until firm. Remove the plastic. Mound the whipped cream on top of the pie and sprinkle with fleur de sel. Cut into wedges and serve.</li>
    </ol>

  <h2 class="article-head"> &nbsp;Chocolate Pretzel Crinkle Cookies</h2>
  <p>&nbsp;Chocolate crinkle cookies are often more cloying than satisfying. By substituting the flour with Glutino pretzels, this version of the holiday staple is not only gluten-free but also perfectly salty-sweet with the best-ever chewy center.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>8 ounces gluten-free pretzels (such as Glutino)</li>
    <li>3/4 cup unsweetened Dutch-process cocoa powder (about 2 1/2 ounces) (see Note)</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
    <li>1 1/2 cups granulated sugar</li>
    <li>3/4 cup canola oil</li>
    <li>4 large eggs</li>
    <li>1 table spoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1 1/2 cups powdered sugar (about 6 ounces)</li>
  </ul>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 350°F. Place pretzels in bowl of a food processor; process until very finely ground, about 1 minute and 30 seconds. (You should have about 2 cups ground pretzels.)</li>
    <li>Whisk together ground pretzels, cocoa, and baking powder in a medium bowl until combined. Beat granulated sugar, oil, eggs, and vanilla in a large bowl with an electric hand mixer on high speed until combined. Stir in ground pretzel mixture until dough comes together. Cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate just until firm, about 2 hours.</li>
    <li>Shape dough into 60 (1-inch) balls; roll in powdered sugar until evenly and generously coated. Arrange balls 2 inches apart on large parchment paper–lined baking sheets. Bake in batches in preheated oven until tops look cracked, 13 to 15 minutes. Let cookies cool on baking sheets 2 minutes. Transfer cookies to wire racks, and let cool completely, 15 to 20 minutes. (If reusing baking sheets, make sure you let them cool completely before adding more cookie dough balls.)</li>
  </ol>

  <h2 class="article-head"> &nbsp;Bacon-Wrapped Dates</h2>
  <p>If you've never tried dates before, let this bacon-wrapped party appetizer be your introduction.

  <h2 class="article-head"> Butternut Squash Lasagna</h2>
  <p>&nbsp;This showstopper butternut squash lasagna ranks right at the top with the best lasagna ever. In fact, this recipe takes a lot of inspiration from the classic version! Think melty, cheesy layers, a heavenly sauce, and hearty meat.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Every layer of this autumn spin is as stunning as the last, from a sage-infused, roasted butternut squash sauce to spicy Italian sausage, fresh mozzarella, and the creamiest spinach and cottage cheese layer</p>
  <ul>
    <li>8 c. pre-chopped butternut squash (about 3 lb.)</li>
    <li>6 fresh sage leaves&nbsp;</li>
    <li>4 tbsp. olive oil, divided</li>
    <li>3 tsp. kosher salt, divided &nbsp;</li>
    <li>1 1/2 tsp. black pepper, divided&nbsp;</li>
    <li>1 lb. hot Italian sausage&nbsp;</li>
    <li>1 1/4 c. half-and-half<br>
    </li>
    <li>1 (10-oz.) package frozen chopped spinach, thawe</li>
    <li>3 c. cottage cheese (large curd)</li>
    <li> 2 large eggs, beaten </li>
    <li>3/4 c. grated parmesan cheese, divided</li>
    <li>4 garlic cloves, finely chopped&nbsp;</li>
    <li>12 lasagna noodles, from 1 (16oz.) package&nbsp;</li>
    <li>8 oz. sliced whole milk mozzarella cheese, divided</li>
    <li>4 oz. fresh mozzarella, sliced</li>
  </ul>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 400°F. On a large rimmed baking sheet, toss together the butternut squash, sage leaves, 3 tablespoons olive oil, 1 ½ teaspoons salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper. Spread into an even layer and roast until the squash is tender, about 45 minutes.</li>
    <li>&nbsp;Meanwhile, heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add the Italian sausage and cook, stirring occasionally to crumble into small pieces, until the sausage is browned and cooked through, about 8 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside. </li>
    <li>Transfer the roasted squash and sage to a food processor with the half-and-half. Puree until the mixture is smooth and creamy, about 1 minute, stopping to scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed. Set aside. </li>
    <li>Wrap the spinach in a double layer of paper towels and squeeze to remove as much liquid as possible. In a large bowl, stir together the spinach, cottage cheese, eggs, ½ cup parmesan, garlic, 1 teaspoon salt, and the remaining ½ teaspoon pepper. Set aside.</li>
    <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil over medium-high heat. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil and ½ teaspoon salt to the boiling water, and cook the lasagna noodles until al dente, about 8 minutes. Drain and lay flat on a lightly greased baking sheet. </li>
    <li>To assemble: Arrange 4 cooked lasagna noodles in the bottom of a 9-by-13-inch baking pan, overlapping slightly if necessary. Spoon one third of the squash puree over the noodles; spread evenly. Top with half of the whole milk mozzarella slices (about 5 slices). Sprinkle evenly with half of the Italian sausage. Spoon half of the cottage cheese mixture over top; spread evenly. Repeat the layers once, ending with the cottage cheese mixture. Top with the remaining 4 noodles and squash puree, spread evenly. Top with fresh mozzarella and sprinkle with the remaining ¼ cup parmesan.</li>
    <li>Cover lasagna tightly with foil. Bake at 400°F for 30 minutes. Uncover, and continue baking until the lasagna is heated through and the top has browned, 20 to 25 minutes. Let stand for 10 minutes before serving.&nbsp;</li>
